Este radar considera cinco ejes fundamentales: diseño ético, alfabetización en IA, uso ético, manejo de riesgos y regulación. Cada eje se analiza a través de una serie de preguntas orientadoras y las aplicaciones reciben puntuaciones numéricas y observaciones cualitativas. El índice del radar se calcula a partir de estas puntuaciones y proporciona una herramienta práctica para comparar y mejorar el desarrollo de la IA.'}\n"
